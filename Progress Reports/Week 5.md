## Week 4 Report (2/1 - 2/7)

### Deadline 2/15/2020 (EOD)

You did not see that I delayed the deadline--did you?



Our objective now is to get something that works to Jeff. We want to have been on the site around the 15th of February. We want to attempt installing the Sensors then so if something is wrong, we will have a few days to fix it.



### Objectives

- [ ] Improve the code( error logging and testing)

  I don't think I have to do that yet. I would prefer to focus on adding more features for now.

- [ ] ADD Turbidity

- [ ] ADD low power mode

  I'm making progress. See notes.

- [ ] show mike how to make the connections.



### Possibly

- [ ] ADD GSM module and remote functionality

- [ ] Test low power mode with GSM module

- [ ] ADD the PH Sensor

- [ ] Begin next week's report

- [ ] ADD PH Sensor

- [x] See If I can make Classes and use OOP with ISR instead of this namespace festival

  No conclusion yet, but it is too early to worry about that now.

- [ ] ADD Dissolved oxygen sensor



### Notes

We need to figure out the pipe-flowmeter-pipe connection once we get the pipes' dimension from Jeff. We need to schedule a meeting with Jeff.

I can use the ULP processor to for the fish counter. I would need to learn and write some assembly. 

Another alternative that someone tried was to make the processor wake up and handle the ISR at the same time. I can do that too, but it feels like a heuristic approach that might fail.

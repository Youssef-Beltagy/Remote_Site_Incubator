## Week 4 Report (2/1 - 2/7)

### Deadline 2/7/2020 (EOD)

Delayed the deadline because both Mike and I have exams on Tuesday.



We changed our objective. Because we might not be able to buy a 3G cellular network module before deployment, we will focus on getting a prototype that works with Wifi for now and add the cellular network once we are confident we can give Jeff a prototype whenever he asks for it.



I discovered the existence of Matlab's ThingSpeak, so we will use that for our server side.



### Objectives

- [ ] WiFi + ThingSpeak

- [ ] ADD low power mode

- [ ] ADD GSM module and remote functionality

- [ ] Test low power mode with GSM module

- [ ] ADD the PH Sensor

- [ ] Begin next week's report

  

### Possibly

- [ ] ADD PH Sensor

- [x] See If I can make Classes and use OOP with ISR instead of this namespace festival

  No conclusion yet, but it is too early to worry about that now.

- [ ] ADD Dissolved oxygen sensor

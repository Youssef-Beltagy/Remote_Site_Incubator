# Progress  (or lack thereof) Report
### By **Youssef Beltagy** and **Mike Miller**

> I spent two hours and half writing the report on google chrome, then I accidentally pressed the F5 button and lost everything. So here is what I managed to redo today.

Lesson Learned: don't work in an environment that doesn't save your progress, even temporarily.

## Objective 
We want to build a sensor-system (we call it *the fish counter*) to observe and document the hatching conditions of fish. For now, we know that we need to deploy a prototype for coho salmon sometime in January of 2020. Later on, we expect that the sensor system would be used to observe Kokanee salmon in the Lake Washington/Sammamish watershed. This project is sponsored by [Jeff Jensen, Ph.D](https://www.uwb.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/biology/jjensen).

## Motivation
Jeff explains "Kokanee populations crashed in Lake Washington in the 1920’s, and in Lake Sammamish in the 1970’s, to the point that native kokanee are known to exist only in a few tributaries of Lake Sammamish." This project is an attempt to help Jeff get more data on Salmon, and automate the data-collection process.

We believe this project is important (and are commited to it) because there is currently nothing similar for this purpose, so what we make will most likely be used and make an effect.

## Specifications
Jeff wants a remote sensor system that make readings and send them to him remotely, so he doesn't have to go down to the incubator to know how the Salmon are doing. Through conversing with him, we identified the quantities and features that he is interested in. Jeff wants to know these quantities (ordered in terms of priority).
1. The number of fish that manage to hatch
2. The waterflow into the incubator
3. The Temperature inside the incubator
4. The Dissolved Oxygen content of incubator
6. The turbidity of the water in the incubator
5. The PH of the water in the incubator

Jeff also wants to be able to install the incubator where our fish counter would not have access to wifi or power. For that we have to solve two technical problems.
1. Communication without WIFI
2. Access to power

## Week 3 Report (1/25 - 1/31)

### Deadline 2/2/2020 (EOD)

This is my last week, nooooooooooooooooo! Somebody save me! I will be sent to the Gallops! 

The SIM Card has arrived! I can start attempting some fancy stuff.



### Objectives

- [ ] ADD the GSM module--could be redundant because I will be using 2G which is mostly too old.

- [x] Figure out how I'm going to get the data from the esp32 to a server-thingspeak by matlab

- [ ] ADD low power mode

- [x] Begin next week's report

- [x] Clean the Code a little

  

### Possibly

- [ ] ADD PH Sensor

- [x] See If I can make Classes and use OOP with ISR instead of this namespace festival

  No conclusion yet, but it is too early to worry about that now.

- [ ] ADD Dissolved oxygen sensor

### Notes

Apparently GSM is 2G which is not well supported in the US. Now, I have to get another module. The funny thing is that I kind of expected that issue but ignored it.

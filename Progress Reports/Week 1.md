### Notes

I didn't manage to do as much as I would have liked to do this week because I was busy applying to the Husky 100 and the research in Germany. I feel my personal story for the Husky 100 sucks. I can think of at least two places where it is inconsistent. Hah, I did my best and I hope I will win. Doing my best is an achievement enough for me.



While I didn't manage to code, I met with mike and measured the power consumption of what we currently have. It needs 0.090 A @ 5 V. While this is likely to change as we add more sensors and a low power mode between readings, it tells us at what order of magnitude the power draw is. We can use that to do some initial research into which batteries we can buy and how big of a solar panel we should use.



We also discussed some next steps. Mike should be working on the updated fish counter design next week. I need to give him a finished prototype by the 2nd of February (EOD). I have two weeks and three weekends to finish the prototype including the remote functionality.



After that, I will work on improving the code, figuring out a good way to receive the information from the incubator, and documenting how the system works and how to use it.

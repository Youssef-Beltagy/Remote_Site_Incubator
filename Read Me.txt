Hello Mike and Kalen,

I'm using Arduino Mega. I intend to switch back to the esp32,
later. Use the Arduino code folder. 

The way I have this organised, for now, is that for every
sensor, I make a folder and a sketch to experiment.

Then there is the Sensor_Network folder that we intend to deploy and that
has everything I succeeded in getting to work. The Sensor_Network sketch is big
enough that an uno will not work properly.

My next steps are:
ADD the Turbidity Sensor
Try to switch back to esp32
Try to add remote functionality for the esp32

# RSI Meeting Agenda/Notes

The current situation is... not so good.
- Everything related to the counter itself is lost
- I still have the code, but We need to choose the microcontroller more carefully, so we may need new code anyway.
- We are back to square one except that we have a better idea of what to do

We also learned a lot of valuable lessons from the last project. Here are some of the reasons I think the project didn't succeed.
- Too many features -- fancy dreams
- Didn't stop and deliver earlier
- Unclear deliverables
- Unclear deadlines
- Inexperience
- Covid-19
- 3D box -- too big (show alternative)

I think it is better to start from scratch. As such, let's go over what the RSI should do in the first place. In this meeting, please help me brainstorm how to make the system as simple and reliable as possible.

## The RSI

Can you please explain the project again?

Can you please explain the technical problem(s)?

## Resources
- How much money do we have for development?
- How much money can a single RSI cost?
- My availability
  - Summer
  - I can't code in Autumn. I can at most help you assemble an RSI in a weekend or so.

## Objectives?
- Data extraction
- Remote Functionality (Data transmission)
- Low Power
- **Reliability** -- the most important
- Extendibility

### Data extraction
- How should you get the data?
- Is that necessary?
- Retrieving the counter and running an extraction program on it?
- SD Card
- FRAM
- Is a display/user-interface absolutely necessary? Otherwise, how will you use the RSI?

### Networking
- Is it absolutely necessary? Why? Why not simply retrieve the data from the RSI later?
- Satellite
- Phone Network
- Wi-fi
- Bluetooth

### Power
- Battery life
- The size of the battery/System
- Is it necessary to make it a low power system?
- Can we use a super capacitor rather than a battery?

### Reliability
- Early testing
- MVPs
- FRAM?

## Web Application
- Is it absolutely necessary? Why?
- What is the minimum it should do?

## Deliverables
What should the deliverables look like?

- Kit for students to make? Which students? I had this written in one of my old notes. "Ideally we should make a kit that costs 400 Dollars or Less"
- Foundation for capstone teams?
- A working system?

## Constraints
Which are more important to you?

- Time
- Money
- Features

## Details
- Fish Length, width, and height
- Fish speed
- Pipe dimensions
- Open Source
- Fish counter as turbidity sensor

## Important Dates
- I intend to discuss the deadlines on a later date, but I included them here for reference.
- Soft deadline â€“ September 15: Have an RSI ready for bio students to set up and install
- Hard deadline - December 1: Have two working RSI's with debugging from fall quarter
- Coho eggs installation: Early December
- The fish move out of the incubator in late February/Early march
